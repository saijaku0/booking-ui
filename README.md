It focused on providing a clean, accessible, and high-performance user interface for both patients and healthcare providers.

## Technical Stack (Frontned & DevOps)
* Framework: Angular 
* UI Components: Angular Material for a professional, consistent, and accessible designe
* State Management: Zustand
* Containerization: Docker
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions

-------------------------------

## UI/UX Description
The user interface is designed with a mobile-first approach, focusing on clarity and ease of use in high-stress
situations (like booking a doctor's visit).

1. Patient Dashboard 
	* Intuitive Search: A prominent search bar to find doctors by specialty, location, or name using Angular Material’s ```Autocomplete```

## Infrastructure & Workflow
* Dockerized Environment: The application is containerized to ensure that the "it works on my machine" problem is eliminated
* GitHub Actions CI: Every push triggers a pipeline that:
	<ol type = "1">
	  <li> Lints the code for consistency </li>
	  <li> Runs unit tests to ensure stability </li>
	  <li> Builds the production Docker image </li>
	</ol>
